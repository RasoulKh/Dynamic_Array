# Dynamic_Array
Defining 1D, 2D, and 3D dynamic arrays, Allocation and de-allocation

A dynamic array is quite similar to a regular array, but its size is modifiable during program runtime.
Once an array has been created, its size cannot be changed. However, a dynamic array is different. A dynamic array can expand its size even after it has been filled.
